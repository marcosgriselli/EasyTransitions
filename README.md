**EasyTransitions** is a library that helps developers create custom interactive transitions using simple functions defined in a protocol and avoid handling with the mutiple transitions API's in UIKit.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è This library is a work in progress (WIP) expect many changes until it reaches 1.0 ‚ö†Ô∏è

The development roadmap will be documented using Github issues, milestones and project. Contributions are welcome! 

## Transitions

Given that `UIViewControllerAnimatedTransitioning` works differently for Modal presentations and `UINavigationController` transitions I've split the functionality in: 

* `ModalTransitionConfigurator`
* `NavigationTransitionConfigurator`

Each of them grabs the available views to perfrom the transition. As read in the docs I avoid grabbing the views directly from the `UIViewControllers` and access them via `UIViewControllerContextTransitioning`'s `view(forKey: UITransitionContextViewKey)`. 

### Modal transitions

Designs from [Meng To](https://twitter.com/mengto)'s [Design+Code](https://designcode.io)

```swift 
public protocol ModalTransitionAnimator {
    var duration: TimeInterval { get }
    var onDismissed: () -> Void { get set }
    func layout(presenting: Bool,
                modalView: UIView,
                in container: UIView)
    func animate(presenting: Bool,
                 modalView: UIView,
                 in container: UIView) 
}
```

During a modal transition we should only manage the view that is being presented modaly (modalView). We can inject animations on the root controller anyway.

The `ModalTransitionAnimator` is a really straight forward protocol. Just layout the views ready to be animated on `layout` function and perform the animations on `animate`. You can check the [AppStoreAnimator](https://github.com/marcosgriselli/EasyTransitions/blob/master/EasyTransitions/Classes/Animators/AppStoreAnimator.swift) for a basic example. 

### UINavigationController transitions

`UINavigationController` have a slightly different approach. Both the _from_ and _to_ view are accessible using `view(forKey: UITransitionContextViewKey)` so we add them to the protocol functions. 

```swift 
public protocol NavigationTransitionAnimator {
    var duration: TimeInterval { get }
    var auxAnimations: (Bool) -> [AuxAnimation] { get set }
    func layout(presenting: Bool, fromView: UIView,
                toView: UIView, in container: UIView)
    func animations(presenting: Bool,
                    fromView: UIView, toView: UIView,
                    in container: UIView)
}
```

I've added the auxiliary animations as part of the protocol but expect multiple changes in this area. 

### UIPresentationController transitions
<img src="https://cdn.rawgit.com/marcosgriselli/EasyTransitions/feature/UIPresentationController_support/presentationController.gif" width="200px"/>

`UIPresentationController` follows the same approach as Modal presentations. The only thing you need to call is `func set(presentationController: UIPresentationController?)` on your `ModalTransitionDelegate` object. 

## Interaction

`TransitionInteractiveController` handles wiring a `UIPanGestureRecognizer` to the current `UIViewController`. This works for any action as we should set the `navigationAction: () -> Void` for the interaction to work. This let's us use the same `TransitionInteractiveController` class for Modal, `UINavigationController` or even `UITabBarController` transitions. 

It's wiring takes a `UIViewController` and a `Pan` object. EasyTransitions handles the swiping automatically. It responds to velocity and completness percentage to finish the transition. I plan to support configuring this. 

Right now the transition will complete if we stop swiping when it's over 50% or if we swipe fast or release. It will cancel it self if we swipe fast and release in the oposite direction.

### Pan 

The `Pan` enum is a simple way to unify `UIPanGestureRecognizer` and `UIScreenEdgePanGestureRecognizer`. Internally EasyTransitions uses `TransitionPanGestureRecognizer` and `TransitionEdgePanGestureRecognier` to support a `PanGesture` protocol which calculates velocity and translation for each gesture and the correct sign they should have. 

```swift 
public enum Pan {
    case regular(PanDirection)
    case edge(UIRectEdge)
}
```

## Usage 

There's an example on `TodayCollectionViewController` but there should't be many changes on other implementations. Here's a generic example: 

```swift 
class MainViewController: UIViewController {
var transitionDelegate = ModalTransitionDelegate()

func showDetailViewController() {
	let detailController = DetailViewController()
	let animator = MyAnimator() // ModalTransitionAnimator
	modalTransitionDelegate.set(animator: animator)
	modalTransitionDelegate.wire(viewController: detailController,
                            	  with: .regular(.fromTop))
        
	detailController.transitioningDelegate = modalTransitionDelegate
	detailController.modalPresentationStyle = .custom
        
	present(detailController, animated: true, completion: nil)
}
```
